# Disappearing-People - Removing a person from complex backgrounds over time. 🕵️

Removing people from complex backgrounds in real time using TensorFlow.js in the web browser using JavaScript. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32507674/136237051-a9c95adb-410d-43c4-8dce-b2976903fc84.png" width=24px>



## What can this project do?

This code attempts to learn over time the makeup of the background present in the video so that I can attempt to remove any humans present in the scene. This is all happening in real time, in the browser, using TensorFlow.js. #MadeWithTFJS <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32507674/136237408-dbf3728d-b41b-441d-a5e5-599b0f6e8dd4.png" width=24px>


This is an experiment. It may not be perfect in all situations.
